## Architecture

- You have 8 HTML files: *index.html*, *inex_not_demo.html*, *404_page.html*, *Login.html*, *Register.html*, *Pricing.html*, *ShowPage.html* and *alerts.html*.
*index.html* includes Vue.js for demo purposes.
*index_not_demo.html* uses pure JavaScript without jQuery, Frameworks or Labraries.
 
- You have *node_modules* folder which contain some JavaScript modules that was installed throught *npm* like *Glide.js* (for carousel), *Animatecss*, *Tailwindcss* and *Free Font Awesome* (For icons).

- you have *dist* folder which contains all the required assets.
- you have *demo_dist* which is not required (*index.html* will not work in case you remove 
it, in contrast *index_not_demo.html*).

*NOTE:* 
We used *Vue.js* Frameworks within *index.html* in order to give the demo some data and make it a little bit reactive. Please check *HTML code*.


## Dependencies

- all the images, videos that are used here have no copyrights, and it is completely free to use.
Check [unsplash](https://unsplash.com) and [pexels](https://pexels.com)  for more info.
- package.json contains the required JavaScript modules. 

## HTML code

*Warning*: Description paragraph in the home page (white and black cards) must be 121 character, in contrast in other pages, it does not matter.

First, we want to inform you that you are not required to use *Vue.js*, you have the choice to remove *demo_dist* Folder and use *index_not_demo.html* file as a reference.
This HTML code was structured to be friendly with W3C standards and we did our best to document the important sections of the code.

*note:* All the alerts and messages components are located inside *Alerts.html*.

## CSS code:

### Inside *dist* folder

- *style.css* which contains the extended css styling over the default styling of Tailwindcss. *style.css* is well organized, small and documented, you can edit on it without any problems. 
Example: if you want to change the *primary* color, just go to *style.css* then scroll down to *Primary Colors*.

## NOTE

In case you wanted to change the other default colors like *green* and *yellow*, then you have to install Webpack to generate your custom *tailwind.css* file which will hold your custom settings and stylings.
* READ THIS *: 
[https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration)

## JavaScript Code 

### Inside *dist* folder

- *script.js* contains some basic code for *toggling, hiding and showing* elements like dropdowns and modals  is well 
organized, small and documented, you can edit on it without any problems.
- *carouselCode.js* contains the basic code to make our carousels wrok as expected, do not forget to check the official
documentation of [Glide.js](https://glidejs.com/).

### Inside *demo_dist* folder

- *script.js* contains some Vue.js code that is used to make *index.html* little bit reactive, it gives you a basic 
understanding of how you will structure you data, you can even translate this file into useful Vue.js components.

## Images & Videos

- Image dimensions:
  - Home page movies Covers must be 128 width x 192 height.
  - Modal video images must be 120 width x 68 height.

We make sure to respect the copyrights of other people, so we designed our demo images using no-copyright images from
