index.html includes Vue.js for demo purposes.
index_not_demo.html uses pure JavaScript without jQuery, Frameworks or Labraries.
 
- You have node_modules folder which contain some JavaScript modules that was installed throught
npm like Glide.js (for carousel), Animatecss, Tailwindcss and Free Font Awesome (For icons).

- you have "dist" folder which contains all the required assets.
- you have "demo_dist" which is not required (index.html will not work in case you remove 
it, in contrast index_not_demo.html).

NOTE:
-----
We used Vue.js Frameworks in index.html in order to give the demo some data and make it a 
little bit reactive. Please check "HTML code" section in order to remove vue.js from the project.
